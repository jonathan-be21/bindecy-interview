<div>
  When this option is checked, and this project is configured to use a Source
  Code Management system, then Jenkins will try multiple times to check out from
  the specified SCM system until it succeeds.
  <p>
    The default behaviour, or if this value is set to
    <code>0</code>
    is to mark a build as failed immediately if checking out from the SCM system
    fails.
  </p>

  <p>
    Setting this to a higher number means Jenkins will attempt to check out from
    the SCM system that many times, with a ten-second delay between retries.
    <br />
    If the final attempt also fails, then the build will be marked as failed,
    and execution will stop.
  </p>

  <p>
    As plugins can contribute different Source Code Management implementations,
    it's up to each individual implementation to define what constitutes a
    checkout failure.
  </p>

  <p>
    If this option is not checked, then the system-wide default value from the
    <i>Configure System</i>
    screen will be used.
  </p>
