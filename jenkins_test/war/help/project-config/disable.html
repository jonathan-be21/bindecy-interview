  When this option is checked, no new builds of this project will be executed.
  <p>
    This can be helpful when you want to temporarily prevent a project from
    being built. For example, if your project depends on some infrastructure
    &mdash; e.g. a test server, or a source code repository &mdash; and you know
    it will be unavailable for a period of time, you could disable the project
    to prevent unnecessary build failures (and any corresponding notifications)
    during this period.

  <p>
    You can also disable (or re-enable) this project by clicking the
    <i>Disable Project</i>
    (or
    <i>Enable Project</i>
    ) button on this project's main page.
