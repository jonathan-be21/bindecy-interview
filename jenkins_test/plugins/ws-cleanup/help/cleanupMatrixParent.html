When this option is enabled, also matrix parent workspace will be cleaned up. Matrix parent job does checkout into its workspace.
However, if it run on the same node  as its sub-jobs, the  workspaces of sub-jobs are sub-directories of matrix parent  workspace. Therefore in these case, when this option is enabled,  workspaces of matrix sub-jobs will be affected, unless appropriate filters are set.
