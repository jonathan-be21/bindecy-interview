	modifying the email before sending. The <em>MimeMessage</em> variable
	is <tt>msg</tt>, the <em>build</em> is available as <tt>build</tt>, a <em>logger</em>
	is available as <tt>logger</tt>. The <em>trigger</em> that caused the email
        is available as <tt>trigger</tt> and all triggered builds are available
        as a map <tt>triggered</tt>.
	<br/><br/>
	You may also cancel sending the email by setting the boolean
	variable <tt>cancel</tt> to true.
        <br/><br/>
        You can set the default pre-send script here and then use
        <tt>${DEFAULT_PRESEND_SCRIPT}</tt> in the project settings to use
        the script written here.
