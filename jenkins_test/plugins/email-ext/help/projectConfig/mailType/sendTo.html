    Place a check next to each group of people you would like to send emails to
    if the trigger is triggered.
    <ul>
        <li>Recipients - those listed in the recipients list at the project level.</li>
        <li>Developers - those who made changes to the code.</li>
        <li>Requestor - the person who initiated the build, if a person (not SCM polling or hook).</li>
        <li>Culprits - used in conjunction with Developers, gets the culprits from Jenkins itself rather than the changeset.</li>
    </ul>
